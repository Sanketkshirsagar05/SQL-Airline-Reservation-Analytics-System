# ✈️ Airline Reservation & Analytics System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Airline Reservation & Analytics System** is a SQL-based project designed to simulate and analyze airline operations. The project uses flight and ticket data to answer real-world business questions such as:  
- Occupancy rates of flights  
- Most profitable routes  
- Crew schedules and planning  
- Price analytics and demand forecasting  

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to build data-driven insights for the aviation industry.

## 📂 Datasets  
The project uses Kaggle datasets related to airline operations. Key datasets include:  

- **airlines_flights_data.csv** – Contains flight details such as airline, flight number, source, destination, timings, class, duration, days left, and ticket price.  
- **flights.csv** – Contains additional journey information such as date of travel, stops, duration, and fare-related details.

## 🛠️ Database Design  
The system is organized into the following key tables:  

- **Flights** – Information about flights, timings, routes, and prices.  
- **Airports** – Source and destination cities mapped to airports.  
- **Passengers** – Passenger details (future scope for ticketing simulation).  
- **Tickets** – Ticket booking details with price and travel class.  
- **Crew** – Crew assignments and schedules.

## 🎯 Key Features & Insights  
1. **Flight Occupancy Rate** – Analysis of how full flights are based on available data.  
2. **Most Profitable Routes** – Identification of high-revenue routes.  
3. **Crew Scheduling** – Crew allocation insights to manage operations efficiently.  
4. **Price Analysis** – Impact of class, stops, and days left on ticket pricing.
