# ✈️ Airline Reservation & Analytics System (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **Airline Reservation & Analytics System** built using **MySQL**.  
It demonstrates how to design and query relational databases for analyzing airline schedules, bookings, and pricing trends.  

The project uses two real-world–like datasets:  
- **`airlines_flights_data.csv`** → Flight schedule & pricing details  
- **`flights.csv`** → Actual journey booking data with prices, stops, and travel dates  

The goal is to perform **exploratory SQL analysis**, generate **business insights**, and simulate a simplified **airline reservation system**.
